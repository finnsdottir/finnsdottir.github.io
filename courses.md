My teaching interests fall into the areas of political sociology, research methods, gender, and media. My teaching is anchored in a goal of fostering independent critical thinking and analytic skills. I strive to provide a rigorous learning environment where students are challenged and supported. I place significant emphasis on research literacy and explain how research design and methods are central to knowledge production. In addition to thinking about methods, I encourage my students to think about research tools as part of the research design process and about how tools like AI can be used effectively and responsibly.

I am the Humanities and Social Sciences Specialist with Digital Research Services at the University of Alberta, housed within Information Services and Technology. Along with my colleagues, we support advanced research computing at the University and across Canada.

I work with humanities and social sciences researchers at the University of Alberta and across Canada. As part of supporting these researchers, I provide training, offer research consulting, and facilitate access to computing resources.

I am the Humanities and Social Sciences Specialist with Digital Research Services at the University of Alberta, housed within Information Services and Technology. Along with my colleagues, we support advanced research computing at the University and across Canada.

My job is to provide support to researchers across the humanities and social sciences as it relates to their particular advanced research computing needs, including providing training, offering research consulting, and facilitating access to computing resources. I’m also a part of the national HSS team at Digital Research Alliance of Canada and as part of that work I’m involved in national research activity and advocacy focused on promoting social science and humanities research and computation along with other HSS specialists at universities across the country.

I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Toronto, awarded in 2024. I am a mixed methods researcher with a substantive interest in women’s representation and gendered inequality in far-right politics. My current research takes up questions of political communication and gender in populist and far-right politics in Canada and in Western Europe using a variety of computational methods and tools. 

I am currently co-lead on a SSHRC Insight Development Grant ()[] interrogating the epistemic struggles between activist groups in contentious border regions.

I am the Humanities and Social Sciences Specialist with Digital Research Services at the University of Alberta, housed within Information Services and Technology. Along with my colleagues, we support advanced research computing at the University and across Canada.

I work with researchers at the University of Alberta and across Canada to provide support to researchers across the humanities and social sciences as it relates to their particular advanced research computing needs, including providing training, offering research consulting, and facilitating access to computing resources.

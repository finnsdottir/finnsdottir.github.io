title: "Far-right populism in Canada and abroad"
---

The contemporary political era is arguably characterized by a resurgence of far-right, nationalist, and populist politics. The re-election of Donald Trump in the USA is but the most recent reminder of the political appeal of far-right populism – far-right populist politicians and political parties have also been successful in France, Italy, India, Brazil, and beyond. 

Despite long having an active underground extreme right movement, Canada has only recently had to contend with a politically significant far-right populist political party. The People’s Party of Canada earned nearly 5% of the popular vote in the 2021 federal elections – doubling their vote share compared to 2019 – by campaigning on the supposed threats of immigration, the failures of the Liberal government, and the crisis of pandemic public health measures.  

In light of the global rise of the populist far-right, the Canadian Review of Sociology is soliciting papers for a special issue addressing far-right populism in Canada in a view to understand the forces driving the success of these parties, as well as their effects on national politics. 

We are broadly interested in papers that touch on the topics of:
 
- Canadian populism in comparative perspective
- Populist communication online and offline
- Use of social media by populist and far-right actors
- Gender and populism
- Race and populism
- Relationships between far-right political parties and social movements
- Factors driving far-right support in Canada and elsewhere, including the pandemic

We are currently still accepting submissions to this special issue. If you are interested in contributing, please email me at finnsdot@ualberta.ca. 

The Canadian Review of Sociology accepts submissions in both English and French (submissions will be reviewed and published in the language they are submitted in). For more information on submission guidelines, please consult the [CRS Author Guidelines](https://www.csa-scs.ca/files/www/Journal/Canadian_Review_of_Sociology__July_2024_EN.pdf).
